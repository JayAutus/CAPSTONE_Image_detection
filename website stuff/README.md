Qual-Bench AI aims to be an artificial intelligence benchmarking website using the Qualcomm AI Hub[1]. The website seeks to evaluate and compare all state-of-the-art (SOTA) object detection models while also providing a comparison of the subsequent models. The platform aims to visualize relevant performance metrics of each object detection AI model available on AI Hub using Qualcomm hardware and multiple runtimes (ONNX, TFLite, Qualcomm AI Engine Direct). 
The objective of this project is to assist developers of applications and AI researchers in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of different object detection models, allowing them to make informed decisions when selecting models for their applications. By integrating Qualcomm AI Hubâ€™s APIs, this platform will streamline the benchmarking process and provide a user-friendly interface to visualize and compare models and choose the best model for their application and device use case.
The scope of the project will be to benchmark all object detection models  on Qualcomm AI Hub trained on the COCO  2017 validation dataset of 5,000 images and provide the following metrics: latency, inference time (ms/image), compute units, estimated peak memory usage and mAP (mean average precision). The benchmark will include all valid device and runtime configurations for each model.
